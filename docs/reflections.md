## ðŸ“˜ Reflections â€” Gower Campbell

Recursion was a wild ride! At first, it felt like some kind of programming magicâ€”functions calling themselves? Mind-blowing. The Russian dolls analogy really helped me visualize it: each function call is like opening a smaller doll, until you reach the tiniest one (the base case), and then everything starts to come back together.

One of my favorite "aha" moments was working through the factorial function and watching the call stack build and unwind. Seeing `4!` become `4 * 3 * 2 * 1` in real-time made recursion click in a really satisfying way.

The auto-graded tasks in the `Tasks/` folder challenged me to think recursively without relying on loops, which was tough at firstâ€”but incredibly rewarding. Writing `sum_recursion.py` taught me how to build up values one call at a time, while `largest_number.py` helped me understand how to compare elements recursively.

The real breakthrough, though, was the **banking app** in the `BankingApp/` folder. Using recursion to **sum deposits** and **count expenses below a threshold** gave me a practical reason to apply what Iâ€™d learned. Mixing that with **file I/O** made the whole project feel much more real-world and complete. I'm genuinely proud of how it turned out.

I still lean toward iteration when performance mattersâ€”especially for big data or memory-sensitive tasksâ€”but recursion has a kind of elegance that makes it perfect for problems that break naturally into smaller parts. Reversing lists, Fibonacci numbers, and summing digits all made so much more sense once I got the recursive mindset.

Next on my list: **memoization**. I want to explore how to optimize recursive functions so they donâ€™t redo the same work over and over. This journey has been all about learning to "think recursively"â€”and now that I can, I donâ€™t want to stop.
