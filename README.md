# **Gower Campbell's Recursion Journey ðŸš€**  

Hey there! Iâ€™m **Gower Campbell**, and this repository is my deep dive into **recursion in Python**. I started with the fundamentalsâ€”**factorials, Fibonacci, summing numbers**â€”then leveled up to real-world applications like a **banking app with recursive transaction processing**. Along the way, I compared recursion vs. iteration, tackled auto-graded challenges, and even incorporated **file I/O** to make things more practical.  

This project marks the end of my **learning journey at HyperionDev as of March 31, 2025**, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with you!  

## **Whatâ€™s Inside?**  
ðŸ“Œ **[recursion/Basics/](https://github.com/GowerCampbell/Recursion/tree/main/Basics))** â€“ Core recursion examples (**factorial, Fibonacci, sum of natural numbers**) to get a solid grasp of recursion vs. iteration.  
ðŸ“Œ **[recursion/Tasks/](https://github.com/GowerCampbell/Recursion/tree/main/Tasks)** â€“ Solutions to auto-graded challenges, like summing a list up to an index and finding the largest number recursively.  
ðŸ“Œ **[recursion/Advanced/](https://github.com/GowerCampbell/Recursion/tree/main/Advanced)** â€“ Fun problems, including **reversing lists, counting evens, and summing digits** using recursion.  
ðŸ“Œ **[recursion/BankingApp/](https://github.com/GowerCampbell/Recursion/tree/main/BankingApp)** â€“ A **banking transaction app** that processes transactions **recursively** and handles **file I/O**â€”my big project!  
ðŸ“Œ **[recursion/docs/](https://github.com/GowerCampbell/Recursion/tree/main/docs)** â€“ My personal reflections on recursion and a **bibliography** of resources that helped me along the way.  

## **Why Recursion?**  
Recursion clicked for me when I saw it as **breaking a problem into smaller, self-similar partsâ€”like Russian dolls!** ðŸŽ­ Itâ€™s elegant but also **tricky with memory**, so I explored **iteration** as well for comparison. Check out my reflections in **[`recursion/docs/reflections.md`](https://github.com/GowerCampbell/Recursion/tree/main/docs/reflections.md)** for more insights!  

### **Explore, experiment, and let me know what you think!** ðŸš€ðŸ’¡

In this version:
- Iâ€™ve updated all links to reflect the folder names starting with **`recursion`** for each respective folder and file.
