# **Gower Campbell's Recursion Journey 🚀**  

Hey there! I’m **Gower Campbell**, and this repository is my deep dive into **recursion in Python**. I started with the fundamentals—**factorials, Fibonacci, summing numbers**—then leveled up to real-world applications like a **banking app with recursive transaction processing**. Along the way, I compared recursion vs. iteration, tackled auto-graded challenges, and even incorporated **file I/O** to make things more practical.  

This project marks the end of my **learning journey at HyperionDev as of March 31, 2025**, and I’m excited to share it with you!  

## **What’s Inside?**  
📌 **Basics/** – Core recursion examples (**factorial, Fibonacci, sum of natural numbers**) to get a solid grasp of recursion vs. iteration.  
📌 **Tasks/** – Solutions to auto-graded challenges, like summing a list up to an index and finding the largest number recursively.  
📌 **Advanced/** – Fun problems, including **reversing lists, counting evens, and summing digits** using recursion.  
📌 **BankingApp/** – A **banking transaction app** that processes transactions **recursively** and handles **file I/O**—my big project!  
📌 **docs/** – My personal reflections on recursion and a **bibliography** of resources that helped me along the way.  

## **Why Recursion?**  
Recursion clicked for me when I saw it as **breaking a problem into smaller, self-similar parts—like Russian dolls!** 🎭 It’s elegant but also **tricky with memory**, so I explored **iteration** as well for comparison. Check out my reflections in **`docs/reflections.md`** for more insights!  

## **How to Run 🏃‍♂️**  
1️⃣ Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/GowerCampbell-RecursionJourney.git
   ```  
2️⃣ Navigate to a folder (e.g., `cd BankingApp`) and run a file:  
   ```bash
   python banking_recursive.py
   ```  
3️⃣ Some files (like in `BankingApp/`) use `transactions.txt` for I/O—make sure it’s in the same directory.  

### **Explore, experiment, and let me know what you think!** 🚀💡
