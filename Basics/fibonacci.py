# fibonacci.py - Gower Campbell  
# Comparing recursive, memoized, and iterative Fibonacci implementations.  
# Explanation of Fibonacci sequence and its applications.

# Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
# The sequence starts like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

# Mathematical definition:
# fib(0) = 0
# fib(1) = 1
# fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) for n > 1

# Fibonacci numbers show up naturally in:
# - Nature (like the pattern of petals in flowers and the spiral arrangement of leaves)
# - Algorithms (for searching, sorting, and dynamic programming)
# - Art and Architecture (in the golden ratio)
# - Finance (for stock market predictions using Fibonacci retracement)
